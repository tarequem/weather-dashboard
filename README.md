# About
* The purpose for this application is to have the user search for cities to find out the weather forecast. On the top left, the user will enter a city and will see its weather forecast after clicking search. Every city searched will be displayed below the search bar as a clickable button which will persist. When the previously searched cities are clicked, the application will return the weather data of that city.
